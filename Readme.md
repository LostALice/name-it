## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions & Pages Demo

This repository demonstrates the use of GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the Next.js application to GitHub Pages.

*   **GitHub Action:** The `.github/workflows/` directory contains a workflow configuration file (e.g., `deploy.yml`) that defines the steps to build and deploy the application whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.  This workflow typically includes:
    *   Checking out the code.
    *   Setting up Node.js.
    *   Installing dependencies.
    *   Building the Next.js application.
    *   Deploying the built application to the `gh-pages` branch.

*   **GitHub Pages:** The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which serves the static files from the `gh-pages` branch.  You can configure GitHub Pages in the repository settings under the "Pages" section.  Select the `gh-pages` branch as the source.
